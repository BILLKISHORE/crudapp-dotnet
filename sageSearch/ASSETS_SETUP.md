# Assets Setup Instructions

## Created Structure:
- ✅ Created `assets/images/` directory
- ✅ Updated `pubspec.yaml` to include assets configuration
- ✅ Created shell script for copying image files

## Manual Step Required:
Since binary files cannot be directly copied with the available tools, please run the following command from the project root directory:

```bash
chmod +x copy_assets.sh
./copy_assets.sh
```

This will copy the three image files:
- `d0d64a44-b202-43a2-ab48-046599552efd.png` → `assets/images/settings_profile_1.png`
- `1f31b1d4-20ab-4560-91b6-06efd4704580.png` → `assets/images/settings_profile_2.png`
- `b4306869-a24c-4b1d-92fc-bc0eeff3acc6.png` → `assets/images/settings_profile_3.png`

## Usage in Flutter:
After running the script, you can use the images in your Flutter app like this:

```dart
Image.asset('assets/images/settings_profile_1.png')
Image.asset('assets/images/settings_profile_2.png')
Image.asset('assets/images/settings_profile_3.png')
```

## Verification:
After running the script, verify that the files exist:
```bash
ls -la assets/images/
```

You should see:
- settings_profile_1.png
- settings_profile_2.png
- settings_profile_3.png
